Tic Tac Toe!!
----------------------------------------------------------------
An interesting board game.


Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------

1) The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2) If you are 'X', then your friend will be 'O'. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3) The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4) When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
